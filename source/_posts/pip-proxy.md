# How the PIP Proxy Works

## 1. Server Runs a SOCKS Server

The first step in setting up a PIP proxy is to have a server that runs a SOCKS server. This server will act as an intermediary to help your local machine access remote resources.

## 2. Local Machine Establishes an SSH Tunnel

To securely connect your local machine to the server with the SOCKS server, you can establish an SSH tunnel. This tunnel will ensure that your data is encrypted while being transmitted between your machine and the server.

## 3. Using PIP with a Proxy

With the SOCKS server and SSH tunnel in place, you can configure PIP to use the proxy for package management. This is typically done using the `--proxy` option or by setting appropriate environment variables.
